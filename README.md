Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mohammad Bigdeli

About Me

I am a back-end developer focusing on Python and frameworks like Django and FastAPI. I seriously entered the world of programming in 2023, and since then, I have been enthusiastically learning and improving my skills in the software development field.

Although I am still at the beginning of my professional path, I have tried to apply my knowledge practically by working on sample projects and showcasing them on GitHub. I love new challenges and am always looking for opportunities that push me out of my comfort zone and contribute to my growth.

Currently, my entire focus is on strengthening my back-end skills, but my long-term vision is to enter the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.

I am passionate about learning new technologies and strive to expand my knowledge every day. If youâ€™re interested in collaboration, exchanging ideas, or creating exciting projects, I would be happy to connect with you!
